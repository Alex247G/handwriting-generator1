to make your own ttf font file go to calligraphr.com or something liek that to get a template and then fill the symbols and letters things in with your handwriting

then put the file in the "assets" folder and edit the python.py to use your ttf file

you can import images as pages in goodnotes so if you use this with chatgpt to get the homework texts you dont need to do anything except importing it to goodnotes anymore
